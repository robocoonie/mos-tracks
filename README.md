# mos-tracks
All of the Marbles on Stream tracks created by either FluffoBorkBork or RoboCoonie, both as a backup and for anyone else that wants to download them.
You can click on Code and download a .zip of all the files or clone the repository to your own instance.
	
From within Windows, you'll proceed to the following folder location: 
	C:\Users\YOUR-USER-NAME\AppData\Local\MarblesOnStream\Saved\CustomMaps\MyCustomMaps. 
	
This can be easily reached by entering %appdata% in the browser bar of your Windows Explorer folder, and going up one folder to Local.

Be sure to replace "YOUR-USER-NAME" with your user name for your computer. Place the maps in that folder. If the folder is not already created, go into Marbles on Stream, 
to the Community tab and click on Create to have the game create the folder location. You'll need to purchase the Builder pack in order to see most of my maps as I don't 
use the standard free builder.

I can be found on twitch.tv/RoboCoonie and twitch.tv/FluffoBorkBork. Fluffo plays MOS; RoboCoonie builds tracks and streams MOS.
